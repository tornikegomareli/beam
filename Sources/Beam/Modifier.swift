  ///     .fill(.regularMaterial)
  ///     .beam()                                // default: medium, colorful, dark
  ///

  ///     .beam(.small, palette: .ocean)
  ///
  /// SearchField(...)
  ///     .beam(.line, palette: .sunset, active: isSearching)
  /// ```
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - size: `.medium` (card-sized, default), `.small` (button-sized), or
  ///     `.line` (traveling beam along the bottom edge).
  ///   - palette: one of `.colorful`, `.mono`, `.ocean`, `.sunset`.
  ///   - theme: `.dark` (default — white highlights on dark surfaces) or
  ///     `.light` (muted pastel beam on white surfaces).
  ///   - active: drives fade in/out. `true` fades in over 0.6 s, `false`
  ///     fades out over 0.5 s. Rendering is fully suspended while faded out.
  ///   - shape: geometric shape the beam traces. Defaults to a rounded rect
  ///     using `cornerRadius`. `.capsule` pills; `.circle` traces the
  ///     inscribed circle. Only honored for `.medium` and `.small` — `.line`
  ///     always renders its own bottom-edge bar. When `shape` is provided,
  ///     `cornerRadius` is ignored.
  ///   - cornerRadius: corner radius for the default rounded-rect shape.
  ///     Defaults to a size-appropriate value (16 for medium/line, 18 for
  ///     small). Ignored when `shape` is set.
  ///   - duration: seconds per full rotation around the border. Defaults to
  ///     1.96 s for medium/small, 2.4 s for line.
  ///   - strength: overall opacity multiplier in `0...1`. `1.0` is full intensity.
  ///   - lensStrength: pixel magnitude of a liquid-glass distortion that
  ///     warps the content *under* the beam as the head passes over it.
  ///     `0` (default) disables the lens. Try `3...6` for a subtle pull;
  ///     higher values read as an obvious bulge. Applied to the receiver
  ///     before the beam overlay, so it only warps what's behind the beam,
  ///     not the beam itself.
  ///   - pulse: a hashable token (typically an incrementing counter, message
  ///     ID, or UUID) that triggers a one-shot lap whenever its value
  ///     changes. Use for transient affordances — a message landed, a file
  ///     saved, a task finished. Independent of `active`: works even when
  ///     `active: false`.
  ///   - onActivate: called when the fade-in completes (or immediately when
  ///     Reduce Motion is on and the beam snaps in).
  ///   - onDeactivate: called when the fade-out completes (or immediately
  ///     when Reduce Motion is on and the beam snaps out).
